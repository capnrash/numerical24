    "Welcome to Lab 04! Throughout the course you will complete a lab assignments like this one. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged. You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, you'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about Lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement Newton & Secant Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare & contrast our 3 root-finding methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive credit for a lab, answer all questions correctly and submit before the deadline.\n",

    "Sometimes we want to write a small function or we want a function that we don't need to keep because we aren't going to use it later. In python we can write functions using a shorthand technique. These small, unnamed (anonymous) functions are called lambda functions. For example, suppose we want to square a number using a lambda function (I know it seems silly but humor me). Here's how we could do this using a lambda function:\n",
