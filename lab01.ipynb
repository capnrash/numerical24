    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged. You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

    "In Numerical Analysis, we will be using common Python libraries to help us perform mathematical operations. A library is an umbrella term referring to a reusable chunk of code. Usually, a Python library contains a collection of related modules and packages.

However, it is often assumed that while a package is a collection of modules, a library is a collection of packages.\n",
