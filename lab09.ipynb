    "Welcome to Lab 09! Throughout the course you will complete a lab assignments like this one. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged. You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

    "Differential equations are relationships between a function and its derivatives, and they are used to model systems in every engineering and science field. For example, a simple differential equation relates the acceleration of a car with its position. Unlike differentiation where analytic solutions can usually be computed, in general finding exact solutions to differential equations is very hard. Therefore, numerical solutions are critical to making these equations useful for designing and understanding engineering and science systems.
