    "Welcome to Numerical Analysis! Throughout the course you will complete a lab assignment like this one. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay - it's encouraged. You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too - the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should not just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is a language, and like natural human languages, it has rules. It differs from natural language in two important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The rules are simple. You can learn most of them in a few weeks and gain reasonable proficiency with the language in a semester.\n",
    "2. The rules are rigid. If you're proficient in a natural language, you can understand a non-proficient speaker, glossing over small mistakes. A computer running Python code is not smart enough to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you write code, you'll make mistakes. When you run a code cell that has errors, Python will sometimes produce error messages to tell you what you did wrong.\n",

If you see an asterisk next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on.\n",

    "1. At the top of your screen, click **Kernel**, then **Interrupt Kernel**. Trying running your code again.\n",

    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart Kernel**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",

    "3. If that doesn't help, restart your server. This is very rarely needed, but it's good to know how to do just in case. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, click **File** again and choose **Hub Control Panel** and select **Stop My Server** to shut it down. Then, after a few moments select **Start My Server** to start it back up.
